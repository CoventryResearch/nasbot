# nasbot

A Python implementation of NASBOT: Neural Architecture Search with Bayesian Optimisation
and Optimal Transport.

## Installation

Install the following packages packages via pip: cython, POT (Python Optimal Transport), 
pygraphviz. pygraphviz is only needed to visualise the networks so it is not necessary
to run nasbot. However, some unit tests may fail.
```bash
$ pip install cython POT pygraphviz
```

Now set HOME_PATH in the set_up file to the current directory, i.e. HOME_PATH =
<path/to/current/directory>/nasbot. Then source the set up file.
```bash
$ source set_up
```

Next, you need to build the direct fortran library. For this `cd` into
`utils/direct_fortran` and run `bash make_direct.sh`. You will need a fortran compiler
such as gnu95. Once this is done, you can run `python simple_direct_test.py` to make sure
that it was installed correctly.

### Testing the Installation
To test the installation, run ```bash run_all_tests.sh```. Some of the tests are
probabilistic and could fail at times. If this happens, run the same test several times
and make sure it is not consistently failing.
